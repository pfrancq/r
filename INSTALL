			|| Compiling and installing R  ||
			 ==============================

Requirements
============

  First of all, you will also need a recent C++ compiler, where recent
means that the compilers are close to C++ standard conforming.


libraries Needed by R
-----------------------------------
  Some libraries are needed by the R project. These libraries must
  be present on the system. "configure" check for these libraries.


  -o- libMysqlclient library must be present on the system. The libMysqlclient Project
      can be found on SourceForge. The R Project has been tested to work with
      clientMysql project at least version. If the library is not found use the
      configure option :
      --with-mysql
      to specify the library location

KDE - QT Frontend :
-------------------

The project can be compiled with an GUI. This GUI is based on the Qt3 library and
also on KDE. The Qt libraries need to be present on the system (both qt and qt-devel).

These GUIs are used to configure the differents methods during run time. These GUI are not essencial since all the methods can be configured by editing the corresponding XML configuration file.

By default, if KDE is install, the GUI part is also compiled.
