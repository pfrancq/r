QUICK BUILD
-----------
How-to build (command-line):
- create a build directory (by exemple /path/to/r/build)
- cd /path/to/r/build
- cmake .. [OPTIONS]
- make or make VERBOSE=1
- sudo make install
- sudo make uninstall (if you want to remove it ...)


ABOUT OPTIONS (when running cmake)
-----------------------------------
In CMake, options are in the form -D<option_name>=<option_value>, where <option_name> (case sensitive) and <option_value> are mandatory.
When you set a value, it's stored in cache, until you provide a new value.

So if you first configure with
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
the first time, the project will be build with debug informations.  Future cmake invocation without paramater (like cmake ..)
still prepare configuration for debug.  You need to set one time the new value for the configuration to update this setting
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
And again, until you didn't say it, cmake will keep this setting.

This is false if you remove the content of your build directory (you must past again your options)...


AVAILABLE OPTIONS (when running cmake)
--------------------------------------
The available options are (also cmake options are still available), and don't forget to use -D<option_name>=<option_value>:

CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/install/top/dir -> where to install files
CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=<Debug|Release> -> where original default is Release
CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug This option generates all the necessary debugging symbols.
disable-mysql=true This option disables the support for MySQL.
disable-sqlite=true This option disables the support for SQLite.
disable-postgres=true This option disables the support for PostgreSQL.
disable-qt=true This option disables the support for Qt.
